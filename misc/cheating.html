<h1>CHEATING</h1>
<p>
While you look through my graphs, you may find yourself thinking:<br>
"Should we really be using this technique?"<br>
"Surely this is cheating?"<br>
"I'm hungry."<br>
All of these are normal thoughts, but the latter two are the ones this page will attempt to address.<br>
(If you are hungry, I cannot be of assistance.)
</p>
<h1>MIN/MAX</h1>
<p>
(Insert link to min/max explanation page)<br>
Is using the min() and max() functions cheating?<br>
Here are the facts:<br>
-min() and max() are built-in Desmos functions.<br>
-2-argument min() and max() can be expressed as (x + y +- |x - y|)/2.<br>
-n-argument min() and max() can be expressed in terms of min() and max().<br>
Personally, I see no issue with using min() and max(). It can be implemented using only the basic operations and saves a lot of time.
</p>
<h1>LISTS</h1>
<p>
(Insert link to list explanation page)<br>
Is using lists cheating?<br>
Here are the facts:<br>
-Lists are a feature of Desmos not normally present in mathematics.<br>
-They allow for multiple equations to be drawn in the same line, but in a particularly inelegant way.<br>
-There are elegant ways of using lists.<br>
Personally, I don't like to use lists just for combining. However, I do use lists when they are a good abstraction.
</p>
<h1>POWER TOWERS</h1>
<p>
(Insert link to 0^x explanation page)<br>
Is using 0^x cheating?<br>
Here are the facts:<br>
-0, infinity exception cases are a built-in feature of Desmos not normally present in mathematics.<br>
-0^0, inf^inf, 0^inf etc. are not normally defined well outside of Desmos.<br>
-Power towers can provide a great shortening to the character count in a line.<br>
Personally, I used to dislike these, since I did not have an intuition for them.<br>
However, with time and practice I have come to use them as I have every other technique.
</p>
<p>
There is more to add. I will be back later.
