<p>
This was the first in a series of four one-liners intended for my entry into the JP Desmos Discord Server.<br>
These were themed around circuit schematic diagrams. In particular, this is a resistor.
</p>
<p>
(Insert "cheating" link here)<br>
The equation is formed as a list of two equations.<br>
Entry 1 of the list is a "bump" function, reflected across the x-axis.<br>
Entry 2 of the list draws the two remaining lines to complete the resistor.<br>
The right side of the equation stops lines from drawing at |x|&gt;2.<br>
(Note to self: place some images here later)
