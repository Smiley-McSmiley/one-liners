<p>
Confusingly, GRATEX 3 was dated earlier on my computer than GRATEX 2.<br>
I believe this is because I was changing computers in early 2024, and in the process of file migration,<br>
the creation dates did not transfer.

If you are used to conventional mathematics, you may be confused by "y^y^0^y".<br>
This is a quirk of Desmos's handling of exception cases like 0^x.<br>
In future, I will add an explanation page for this.
