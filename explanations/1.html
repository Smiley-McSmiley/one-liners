This is the first graph saved to the "GRATEX" folder on my computer. I did make some one-liners previously, but I had not seriously committed up until this point.<br>
Back in early 2024, I began making and posting these one-liners in the hope that practicing would make me better at constructing them. I was correct about that.<br>
This expression shows that I have some grasp on the fundamentals, but that I have not mastered my technique yet. Today I would have considered this poor form.<br>
Now, I should explain the fundamentals. (WIP)
