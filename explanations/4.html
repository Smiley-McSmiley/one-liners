I found this neat pattern while experimenting.<br>
|(x,y)| is the distance to the point (x,y), or if you prefer, the magnitude of the vector (x,y).<br>
Understanding how sin() affects this is a matter I struggle to explain.<br>
Most graphing techniques are founded upon experimentation. You should open a graphing calculator and try it yourself.

This is also the first time I used polynomial simplification to achieve a lower character count.<br>
x * y * (x-y) * (x+y) = xy(x^2-y^2).
