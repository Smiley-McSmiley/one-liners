This graph is relatively easy to wrap your head around.<br>
Points can be thought of as a distance from the origin and an angle to the x-axis.<br>
In the case of this graph, it is plotting every point (r,θ) for which θ &lt; π sin r.<br>
Looking closely, it's the positive part of a sine wave wrapped around so that it covers the entire graph.

Those of you who have used Desmos before may have noticed something strange, though.<br>
Desmos cannot plot graphs of polar equations that are nonlinear in r.<br>
So how was this plotted?

Depending on where you live, you may already be familiar with these substitutions.<br>
The distance a point is from the origin (which is assigned as r here) is equivalent to √x²+y².<br>
The angle of a point to the x-axis is usually taught as atan(y/x), but this runs into issues I struggle to explain.<br>
The programmers will recognize this problem, and will know about atan2(). Desmos has this built into the arctangent function.
